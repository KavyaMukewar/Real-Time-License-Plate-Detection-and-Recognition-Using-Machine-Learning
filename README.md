# Real-Time-License-Plate-Detection-Using-ML

This project develops an intelligent system for detecting and recognizing vehicle license plates in real-time, leveraging the Florence 2 model for robust image processing and TensorFlow for machine learning. The system processes input video streams or images to identify license plates and extract text information using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).  

Key features include:  
- **Florence 2 Integration**: Utilizes the Florence 2 model for state-of-the-art object detection, ensuring high accuracy even in challenging conditions like poor lighting, motion blur, or tilted angles.  
- **TensorFlow Framework**: Implements TensorFlow-based deep learning pipelines for efficient data preprocessing, detection, and recognition of license plates.  
- **Streamlit for Deployment**: The entire application is hosted on a user-friendly Streamlit interface, enabling seamless interaction and live demonstrations of real-time functionality via a web platform.  

This system is ideal for applications in traffic monitoring, automated toll collection, and smart parking solutions. Its ability to deliver fast, accurate, and scalable results underscores its utility in modern intelligent transportation systems.
